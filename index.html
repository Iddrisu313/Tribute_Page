                Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) born in Gombe, and commonly known as Sheikh Pantami, 
                an Islamic cleric who is currently serving as Minister of Communications and 
                Digital Economy in Nigeria.He was the Director General of the National Information
                 Technology Development Agency (NITDA) of Nigeria from 26 September 2016 to 20 August
                  2019 when he was nominated as minister and sworn into office on 21 August 2019.Pantami 
                  is among seven Readers (Associate Professors) promoted to Professor by the Governing 
                  Council of Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) at its 186th meeting held on 
                  Friday, August 20, 2021.However, this promotion continues to generate controversy, and 
                  has been strongly questioned by some intellectuals on allegations  that it did not follow
                   the extant due process in professorship appointments in Nigeria academia.
                 During all this controversial, nor any word was had from pantami.
                 Pantami was a Lecturer at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi in Information Technology 
                 before joining the Islamic University of Madinah at the new faculty of Computing and Information 
                 Systems as Head of Technical Writing in 2014.
                 After President Muhammadu Buhari was re-elected and his cabinet reshuffled in 2019, Pantami was appointed to become the first Minister of Communications and Digital Economy after the renaming of the title to include "Digital Economy."

Based on feedback received from the security agencies following the revalidation of improperly registered SIM cards in September 2019 and the blocking of those that failed to revalidate their SIMs, Pantami directed the Nigerian Communications Commission to implement the SIM Card registration and usage policy which seek to ensure an individual can only have a maximum number of 3 SIM cards, while new users of existing users are expected to update their details with their NINs before December 1, 2020.[12] Due to this, on 13 Feb 2020, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau openly threatened Pantami and condemned the new policy to restrict the number of mobile SIM cards a subscriber can legally own to three. Shekau also reminded Pantami of the fate of Sheikh Ja'afar Mahmud Adam, a cleric that was assassinated in his mosque in Kano, and called on terrorists across Africa to target him saying, “My brothers in Africa, Nigeria or elsewhere, what happened to Jaafar is nothing, take action on Isa Ali Pantami wherever you find him.[13]”

Pantami is a fellow of the British Computer Society (FBCS) and the Nigeria Computer Society (FNCS).[14]

Pantami assumes Chairmanship of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Forum on May 2022. This followed the inauguration by the Secretary General of International Telecommunication Union (ITU) at Geneva, Switzerland.[15]
